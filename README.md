# PointSlope
This program graphs a line in console using OOP methodologies. Custom openGl libraries were provided for this class project and we used mutlipe files and multiple objects to perform simple tasks like converting forms between point slope and slope intercept form as well as being able to graph either form. This was my first exposure to using this type of file structure and it helped me understand how we can better oganize our code as software engineers.
